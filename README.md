# K-Means Clustering with Principal Component Analysis
K-Means Clustering with Principal Component Analysis

This is a sample Python code for K-Means clustering of sample text data with PCA dimensionality reduction. The code is documented (commented at parts) for easier understanding. 

For visualization, Matplotlib was used. For intrinsic evluation of clusters, the Silhouette scores from Scikit Learn is calculated.
